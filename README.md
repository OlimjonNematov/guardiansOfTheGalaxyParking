# guardians Of The Galaxy Parking
This is an academic project.
Using the concepts of Object oriented programming, I have to create a program that monitors the parking lot of a increasingly popular planet. The guardians of the galaxy have decided to make this planet their base, for this reason, it has become a touritst attraction for species of all kinds around the milky way. This program monitors a parking lot for ships that has 10 spaces. When a ship arrives, they have to check in, if the lot has an empty space, the ship will pay the fee and is allowed to park for the alloted time they payed for. If the lot does not have spaces, it will add the ship into a queue formed using a linked list. When a ship leaves the lot, the next ship in the queue will occupy the space. If, when the ship leaves, it will have stayed for longer than the alloted time, the program will generate a fine that penelizes the ship for every minute spent over time.
